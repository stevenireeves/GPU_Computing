## Demonstration Codes from GPU Computing

These are the code demos and supplemental source files for GPU Computing, taught by Steven I Reeves. PhD. 

The Mandelbrot code was slightly modified from Ben Hiller's code 
https://github.com/benhiller/cuda-mandelbrot

Additionally, some codes are inspired by examples in the CUDA programming guide. 

For the 2024 session, we will be utilizing the cuda directory for example programs. The hip directory is for the HIP model of programming for AMD/NVIDIA GPUs. The hip directory is not maintained following 2022.
