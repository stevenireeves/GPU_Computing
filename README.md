## Demonstration Codes from GPU Computing

These are the code demos and supplemental source files for GPU Computing, taught by Steven I Reeves. PhD. 

The Mandelbrot code was slightly modified from Ben Hiller's code 
https://github.com/benhiller/cuda-mandelbrot

Additionally, some codes are inspired by examples in the CUDA programming guide. 

There are two folders, the cuda directory and the hip directory. The cuda directory is for codes taught before 
Spring 2022. The hip directory is for 2022 onwards. 


This new branch tests Pull requests!
